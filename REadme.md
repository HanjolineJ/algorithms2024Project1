# Algorithms 2024 Project 1 Hanjoline Julceus

Algorithms 2024 Project 1 is a Java-based project exploring merge sort 1-4 algorithms 

## Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/HanjolineJ/algorithms2024Project1.git
```
## Overview
This project explores algorithmic techniques, particularly focusing on the divide-and-conquer method, with practical examples like Merge Sort.

Divide-and-Conquer Technique

The divide-and-conquer approach is a algorithmic technique where a problem is divided into subproblems, which are solved independently, and the results are merged. This method is commonly used in Merge Sort 


## Merge Sort Steps

Divide the array into two halves

Recursively sort each half

Merge the two sorted halves into a final sorted array
